Replication documents for Subject to Change (Foster 2023)

Subject to Change takes event-level news articles from the UCDP GED and aggregates them for non-state actors. 

It then runs a Structural Topic Model on the corpus of news snippets associated with each group. The output is aggregated at the group-year and produces an analysis of underlying trends. 

The output summarizes potential years in which third-party observers changed the underlying thematic presentation of the activities of each militant group.
