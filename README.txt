Replication documents for Subject to Change (Foster 2023)
Subject to Change takes event-level news articles from the UCDP GED and aggregates them for non-state actors. It then runs a Structural Topic Model on the corpus of news snippets associated with each group. The output is aggegated at the group-year and produces analysis of the underlying trends. The output summarizes potential years in which third-party observers changed the underlying thematic presentation of the activities of each militant group.
